# Search Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI assistant was giving wrong answers and citing incorrect PDF files because the search algorithm was matching irrelevant text chunks.

## Root Causes

### 1. Substring Matching Without Word Boundaries
**Before:** The word "test" would match:
- "la**test**"
- "fa**test**"
- "con**test**"
- "**test**ing"

**After:** The word "test" only matches:
- "**test**" (as a complete word)

### 2. Naive Scoring Algorithm
**Before:** Counted how many query words appeared in each chunk (presence-only)
- A word appearing 1 time = score of 1
- A word appearing 100 times = still score of 1

**After:** Counts actual occurrences (Term Frequency)
- A word appearing 1 time = score of 1
- A word appearing 100 times = score of 100

### 3. Single Chunk Context
**Before:** Only used 1 chunk (topK=1)
- If that single chunk was wrong, the entire answer was wrong
- No fallback or additional context

**After:** Uses 5 chunks (topK=5)
- More comprehensive context
- Wrong matches have less impact
- Better coverage of relevant information

### 4. Limited Context Size
**Before:** Only 500 characters of context
**After:** 2000 characters of context

## Code Changes

### SimpleSearchService.cs
```csharp
// OLD: Substring matching with simple counting
int score = words.Count(w => normText.Contains(w));

// NEW: Word boundary matching with term frequency
var pattern = $@"\b{Regex.Escape(word)}\b";
var matches = Regex.Matches(normText, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
score += matches.Count;
```

### AIAssistant.cs
```csharp
// OLD: Single chunk, limited context
int topK = 1
if (context.Length > 500)
    context = context.Substring(0, 500);

// NEW: Multiple chunks, more context
int topK = 5
if (context.Length > 2000)
    context = context.Substring(0, 2000);
```

## Example Impact

### Query: "What is dependency injection?"

**OLD Search Behavior:**
```
Query words: [dependency, injection]
- Matches "The latest depends on injection..." (score: 2)
- Matches "Test depends on the independent code..." (score: 1)
Result: Wrong chunk selected, wrong answer given
```

**NEW Search Behavior:**
```
Query words: [what, dependency, injection]
- "dependency" appears 5 times, "injection" appears 4 times = score: 9
- "dependency" appears 2 times, "injection" appears 1 time = score: 3
- "dependency" appears 1 time, "injection" appears 2 times = score: 3
Result: Most relevant chunks with highest term frequency selected
```

## New Features

### 1. Debug Logging
Enable to see exactly which chunks are being matched:

```csharp
assistant.EnableDebugLogging = true;
```

Creates `search-debug.log` with output like:
```
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] Search query: 'dependency injection' => 2 search terms: [dependency, injection]
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] Found 12 chunks with matches, returning top 5
[2024-01-15 10:30:45]   - Score: 9.0, File: CSharp-Guide.pdf, Page: 15, Preview: Dependency injection is a design pattern...
[2024-01-15 10:30:45]   - Score: 6.0, File: Design-Patterns.pdf, Page: 42, Preview: The injection pattern allows...
```

### 2. Improved Source Display
**Before:**
```
Sources:
- CSharp-Guide.pdf
- Design-Patterns.pdf
```

**After:**
```
Sources:
- CSharp-Guide.pdf (Pages: 15, 16, 18)
- Design-Patterns.pdf (Pages: 42, 45)

[Found in: CSharp-Guide.pdf, Page 15]
```

## Files Changed

1. **SimpleSearchService.cs** - Core search algorithm improvements
2. **AIAssistant.cs** - Better defaults and debug logging
3. **.gitignore** - Exclude debug logs from version control
4. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Complete debugging guide

## Testing the Fix

1. Run the application
2. Enable debug logging (optional):
   ```csharp
   assistant.EnableDebugLogging = true;
   ```
3. Ask a question about your documents
4. Check that:
   - The answer is now correct
   - Sources show the right files and pages
   - Debug log (if enabled) shows high scores for relevant chunks

## Performance Impact

- **Regex matching:** Slightly slower than substring matching, but more accurate
- **More chunks:** Using 5 instead of 1 means more context to process
- **Larger context:** 2000 chars vs 500 chars means more tokens to LLM
- **Overall:** Minor performance impact, major accuracy improvement

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing code continues to work
- Default parameter values provide better behavior
- Optional debug logging doesn't affect normal operation
- No breaking API changes
