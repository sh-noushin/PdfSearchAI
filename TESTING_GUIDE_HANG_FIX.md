# Testing Guide for AI Assistant Hang Fix

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to test the fixes for the AI Assistant hanging issue.

## Test Database Setup

A test database has been created with sample PDF content about:
- **DependencyInjection.pdf** (3 chunks)
- **SoftwareArchitecture.pdf** (3 chunks)
- **DesignPatterns.pdf** (4 chunks)

**Total:** 3 files, 10 chunks of quality test data

### Location
```
/home/runner/work/PdfSearchAI/PdfSearchAI/test_database.db
```

### Create Test Database
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/PdfSearchAI/PdfSearchAI
bash /tmp/create_test_database.sh
```

### Verify Test Database
```bash
bash /tmp/test_database_service.sh
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Question Validation ✅

**Purpose:** Test input validation

**Steps:**
1. Launch InternalAIAssistant
2. Configure database to use test_database.db
3. Try to send an empty question (just press Enter)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Error message: "Please enter a question."
- ✅ No hang
- ✅ UI remains responsive

### Scenario 2: Normal Query with Test Database ✅

**Purpose:** Test normal operation with real data

**Test Questions:**
1. "What is dependency injection?"
2. "Explain the benefits of dependency injection"
3. "What are design patterns?"
4. "Tell me about software architecture patterns"
5. "What is the singleton pattern?"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Query completes within 10-30 seconds (with Ollama)
- ✅ Answer is relevant and based on database content
- ✅ Sources section shows correct PDF files and page numbers
- ✅ UI shows "AI is thinking..." then answer
- ✅ No hanging

**Example Expected Output:**
```
Question: What is dependency injection?

Answer: Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that implements 
Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. In this pattern, objects 
receive other objects that they depend on, rather than creating them internally...

Sources:
- DependencyInjection.pdf (Pages: 1, 2, 3)
```

### Scenario 3: Ollama Not Running Test ✅

**Purpose:** Test error handling when LLM service is unavailable

**Steps:**
1. Stop Ollama service (if running)
2. Launch InternalAIAssistant with test_database.db
3. Ask: "What is dependency injection?"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Request times out after ~3 minutes (not indefinitely)
- ✅ Error message: "Error generating answer... Please ensure Ollama is running and the 'phi3' model is available."
- ✅ UI remains responsive
- ✅ User can ask another question

### Scenario 4: Empty Database Test ✅

**Purpose:** Test handling of empty database

**Steps:**
1. Create empty database: `touch /tmp/empty_test.db`
2. Configure InternalAIAssistant to use empty database
3. Try to ask a question

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ System message shows: "Found 0 chunks from 0 files"
- ✅ When asking question: "No documents found in the database. Please ensure PDFs have been processed by PdfChunkService."
- ✅ No hang
- ✅ Clear guidance to user

### Scenario 5: Multi-Language Support ✅

**Purpose:** Test language detection and response

**Test Cases:**

**English:**
- Question: "What is dependency injection?"
- Expected: Answer in English

**Persian/Farsi:**
- Question: "وابستگی تزریق چیست؟"
- Expected: Answer in Persian/Farsi (if Ollama model supports it)

**German:**
- Question: "Was ist Dependency Injection?"
- Expected: Answer in German

**Note:** Language response depends on Ollama model capabilities. The important test is that:
- ✅ Persian is detected (Unicode range \u0600-\u06FF)
- ✅ German is detected (umlauts or keywords)
- ✅ Appropriate language instructions are sent to LLM

### Scenario 6: Large Context Test ✅

**Purpose:** Test handling of queries that match many chunks

**Steps:**
1. Ask a broad question: "Tell me everything about design patterns and software architecture"
2. This should match multiple chunks

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Context is limited to 16000 characters
- ✅ Query completes within timeout
- ✅ Answer is coherent despite large context
- ✅ Multiple sources are listed

### Scenario 7: Database Query Timeout Test ✅

**Purpose:** Test database timeout handling (simulated)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Database queries have 30-second timeout
- ✅ If timeout occurs: "Database query timed out. Please try again."
- ✅ No indefinite hang

**Note:** Hard to test with small database, but timeout is implemented

### Scenario 8: Performance Monitoring ✅

**Purpose:** Test performance feedback

**Steps:**
1. Ask several questions
2. Watch for system messages

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ If response > 30 seconds, message appears:
  "Response time: X.Xs (Consider using a faster model if this is too slow)"
- ✅ Helps user understand performance

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

**Timeout Errors:**
- Increase timeout values if infrastructure is slow
- Check Ollama is running and responsive
- Verify model is downloaded

**Database Errors:**
- Recreate test database: `bash /tmp/create_test_database.sh`
- Check database file permissions
- Verify SQLite is installed

**LLM Errors:**
- Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
- Check model: `ollama list`
- Pull model: `ollama pull phi3`

**Build Errors:**
- This is a Windows app - building on Linux will fail
